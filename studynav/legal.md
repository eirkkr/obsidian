## 1. Current IP Ownership

### 1.1 Ownership claim

#### 1.1.1 Summary

According to Curtin's '*Intellectual Property Policy*' (March 2024):

> *3.1.2 If an employee develops, creates or authors IP that is not related in any way to their course of duties or a University project and has not used any University resources in developing, creating or authoring that IP, then the employee owns that IP.*

I claim that the creation of the IP was:

1. Not related to my '*course of duties*',
2. Not related to a '*University Project*', and
3. Did not make use of any '*University Resources*'

Hence, I maintain sole ownership of the IP.

The remainder of this section explains this claim in-depth, using references to the relevant definitions in the 'Intellectual Property Policy'.

#### 1.1.2 Course of Duties

Definition from section 5 of Curtin's '*Intellectual Property Policy*' (March 2024):

> *Course of Duties
>
> The scope of duties as set out in the terms and conditions of any relevant enterprise bargaining agreement, contract of employment, duty statement or any other agreement between the individual and the University in effect at the time at which the IP was generated.*

**Contract of Employment**:
- blah

**Duty Statement (Position Description)**:
- blah

**EBA**:
- blah

**Other Agreements**:
- I do not have any other agreements with the University

**TODO**: Clarify what WOULD put this under my scope of duties? E.g. if I was tasked with working on it? Doesn't need to be an official contract?

Upon my own reading of my latest contract of employment, position description, and the EBA, there is nothing that indicates developing this IP would be considered part of my scope of duties, and there are no other agreements I am aware of that would make this part of my scope of duties.

**TODO**: Dive deeper into my PD and Contract and discuss point-by-point how each one would not put creation of this IP under my scope of work.

#### 1.1.3 University Project

**Definition from section 5 of *'Curtin's Intellectual Property Policy' (March 2024)***

> University Project
>
> *Work or research administered by or on behalf of the University which:
>
> (a) is funded wholly or in part by a sponsor; or
>
> (b) is commissioned or otherwise funded by the University; or
>
> (c) uses or incorporates University IP or University resources or both; or is a collaborative project, which is either:
>
> (i) a program of work conducted by more than one originator, where each originator's contribution to the IP cannot be separated from the contribution made by other originators; or
>
> (ii) a program of work that originates from, or is an improvement to, University IP.*

The creation of the IP was not administered by or on behalf of the University in any way, hence is not a 'University Project', nor does it relate to one. To further demonstrate the point, very few Curtin staff were even aware that I was working on it, and none who work in a capacity to administer such a project.

#### 1.1.3 University Resources

Definition from section 5 of *'Curtin's Intellectual Property Policy' (March 2024)*

> *University Resources
>
> Resources belonging to the University including without limitation, premises; infrastructure; facilities; funds; services; equipment; paid leave; and employee or University Associate’s time.*

When creating the app, I have been extremely careful to work on it:
1. Completely away from Curtin campuses, predominantly in my own home (*premises*)
2. Using none of Curtin's infrastructure. This includes digital infrastructure such as Curtin's VPN, applications (e.g. Student One), and cloud infrastructure. I have never accessed any of Curtin's systems or data to work on the IP, even when it would have been beneficial to do so. I provisioned and paid for my own cloud infrastructure rather than using Curtin's existing infrastructure. To further demonstrate the point, if I completely lost all my access to Curtin's infrastructure, it would have made no
3. As per point 1, I worked on the app entirely away from campus, and hence made no use of Curtin facilities.
4. Entirely on my own, and outside of working hours (*employee or University Associate’s time*)
5. , use only my own equipment (computers). I have also been careful not to use any of Curtin's digital infrastructure,

In my creation of the IP, I have been very careful to:
- Complete any work on premises
- Use any University infrastructure
- Use any

**TODO**: Since I have created some of the IP during my long service leave the claim of 'paid leave' as a University resource could be relevant. HOWEVER, it is worth noting that the definition of University Resources did not exist in the prior, March 2017 policy and hence would not include 'paid leave'. Creation of the IP began in March 2023, which is prior to the addition of the 'University Resources' definition and 'paid leave' in the March 2024 Policy.

This point definitely needs to be clarified, one interpretation would mean that any staff member creating ANY IP during their paid leave, would be owned by the University, even it it was entirely unrelated to their work at the university. This seems very unreasonable, and against the spirit of the purpose of the Intellectual Property Policy:

> *2. PURPOSE
>
> Curtin seeks to foster a culture which values and rewards technology transfer and entrepreneurial endeavour; promotes collaboration between the University, staff and industry; and maximises the benefits to Australia from publicly funded research. Curtin encourages staff to actively engage in commercialisation of intellectual property (IP) and be rewarded for that activity.*

### 1.2 Argument

This section explains the reasons why I maintain sole ownership of the IP.

Section `3.1` of Curtin's Intellectual Property Policy (March 2024):

> 3.1 Ownership of IP by employees
>
> 3.1.1 Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the University owns all IP developed, created, authored or otherwise contributed to by an employee:
>
> (a) in their course of duties; or
>
> (b) pursuant to a University project, that is not artistic work, scholarly work or indigenous cultural and intellectual property (ICIP). This ownership is not impacted by whether or not the employee’s involvement was outside of work hours or used resources other than University resources.
>
> 3.1.2 If an employee develops, creates or authors IP that is not related in any way to their course of duties or a University project and has not used any University resources in developing, creating or authoring that IP, then the employee owns that IP.

Curtin's intellectual property procedures (May 2019), clause `2.1.2` states that:

> *2.1.2 If a member of staff has created any IP that is not related in any way to the work in their course of duties, and he or she has not used any University resources in creating that IP, then ownership of such IP will vest in the member of staff, unless otherwise specified in the IP Policy or agreed in writing between the parties.*

According to clause `3.1.1` of Curtin's '*Intellectual Property Policy*' and clause `2.1.2` of Curtin's '*Intellectual Property Procedures*', due to the fact that the creation of the IP was:

1. Not related to my *course of duties*; and
2. Not related to a *University Project*; and
3. Did not make use of any *University Resources*

I maintain ownership of the IP.

Whilst not factor for ownership of the IP according to the policy or procedures, due to being mentioned in clause `2.1.1` (below), it is worth noting that the IP was created:

1. Entirely outside of working hours; and
2. Entirely off University premises

> *2.1.1 Subject to the terms set out in these Procedures and the IP Policy, ownership of all IP created by a member of staff in their course of duties will vest in the University unless specifically excluded. For the purpose of this clause, the University will own all IP created by a member of staff regardless of whether or not: (a) the IP was created inside and/or outside working hours and on and/or off University premises; and (b) University resources were used in the creation of the IP*

My employment contract, nor any other contract I have with Curtin contains any mention of IP ownership (other than referencing the Intellectual Property Procedures). Therefore no contract is in place that invalidate clause `2.1.2` of the intellectual property procedures.

## 2. IP Ownership Risks

Factors that could jeopardise my ownership of the intellectual property.

### 2.1 Change in Course of Duties

If continued creation of the IP becomes part of my course of duties with Curtin.

**Mitigation**

The following are mitigation strategies that would

1. Agree in writing with Curtin University, that I maintain sole IP ownership in the event that I engage in creation of the IP under
2. Clarify in writing with Curtin, what is considered to creation of the IP as part of my course of duties. Once clarified, avoid engaging in this activity.
3. If (1) is not possible, and (2) presents too much of a risk that I would inadvertently work onthe only other safe approach would be to resign from Curtin, and refuse to do any work on the.

### 2.2 Making use of Curtin resources

Owner

### 2.3 Other Factors

Potential complicating factors:

1. Curtin University is a potential customer for the IP
2. Whilst the IP is not been related to my 'course of duties', this could change in the future. E.g., I could be tasked with working on problems that the IP aims to solve.

Questions are raised about the potential future state of the IP ownership.

My situation could change in the future, which could pose questions about IP ownership claims:

1. Working on

However, it is possible that the work I have done could relate to future work that I might do in the course of my duties.

1. Is it worth drafting up an NDA? Probably not, is my guess.
2. What if my team starting working on something similar to this project?
3. Should I get a contract created that Curtin would sign, in order to protect my IP?
4. What if my team wants to start using my app.
5. Can I get Curtin staff to do testing of the app without having issues? If so, could I get them to do it outside of their work hours without risk?
6. Using some work time to demonstrate what I've done, is this safe, or should I not track this as work hours?

## 2. License to University

Discuss University license.
