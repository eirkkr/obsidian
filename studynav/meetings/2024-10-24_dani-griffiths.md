# Phone call with Danielle Griffiths

Summary of brief phone call with Dani.

Dani will be having dinner with her IP law expert from Sydney tomorrow evening (2024-10-25). She will explain my circumstances to her, then get back to me with recommendations as to whether I should book something in now or later etc.

She will also take a couple of photos that she has of an IP law book, which she will send to me to see if it's something I would like to borrow.
