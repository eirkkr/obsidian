# Meeting with Danielle Griffiths

## Context

- Who: Danielle Griffiths
- Where: La Mint Cafe, Tech Park Bentley
- When: 2024-10-01 ~12:00 -> 13:00

## Summary

- Based on our discussion, Dani thinks I should be in the clear as far as IP ownership goes, but she has some recommendations to help protect my IP and to begin commercialisation.
- Create a document with evidence that shows that project is out-of-scope of the work of my current role at Curtin. Document when that stuff occurred, and when I started working on the app. This can include work emails, and documents.
- Perhaps don't look to Curtin as the first customer, to make the separation clear, perhaps look to Murdoch contacts as first customer?
- Should get advice from the IP lawyers before starting to commercialise.
- Read up on UWA vs Gray, most relevant case related to this.
- Include documentation of how this came about: i.e. I identified a gap in the market, tried to pursue my own entrepreneurial interest, drawing from my own skillset and interest in the area. Something I was was doing as a sideline endevour.
- Consulting options are 'Wrays consulting', and 'Griffith Hack' is another.
- Next steps are preliminary consultation with IP lawyer.
- Review my contract to make sure it doesn't include commercialisation aspects (this should be fine since I'm not doing a research role).
- Look at enrolling in a commercialisation course. Dani can find a few suggestions for stuff to enrol in. Probably don't do the Curtin one.
- Look at Seqta, they started out similar to this.
- Look up this: Michael (Danis bro) buildkite. Keith Pitt good friend of Michael. Came up with a way to do maintenance on websites without taking them down. Took out 40 under 40 years ago.
- Dani even offered to potentially become my business development person if I get successful enough.
- Research gemaker, they do commercialisation advice more broadly.

## Notes

- Document the fact that we stopped working on. Get evidence of when I started working on this.
- When that scope was completely removed from that work.
- Document that it happened after the scope of it being removed.
- UWA vs Gray - look at this case. READ THIS!
- Common law / case law. most recent binding precedent. Doc
- More about scope. If you pick up something that relates to the role.
- Document when the scope finished, and when it begin.
- If you can evidence that the particular scope was removed.
- Identified a gap in the market, tried to pursue my own entrepreneurial interest, drawing from my own skillset and interest in the area. Something I was was doing as a side-line endevour.
- Completely separate, would have no impact on the work my team gets done.
- Would be good to get some good advice, Dani can recommend some.
- Wrays consulting.
- Griffith Hack is another one.
- Document everythingâ€¦
- At this stage, the best thing you can do is to gather all the information I have that demonstrates what we talked about.
- Spreadsheet the salient points about when in happens.
- Preliminary consultation with a IP lawyer.
- Don't release it until I've had these discussions
- Usually Dani is talking to researchers, they are hired by unis. They have it in the scope of their role to invent stuff.
- Review my contract to be sure of that commercialisation. Just be ready for that.
- The current model for researchers is that.
- Investment. Don't need to worry about this yet, since I can do it cheap.
- Not had much exposure to commercialisation.
- Look at enrolling in a commercialisation course. Dani can find a few suggestions for stuff to enrol in.
- Seqta, communication platform between the school and kids. They started a bit like this.
- Michael (Danis bro) buildkite. Keith Pitt good friend of Michael. Came up with a way to do maintenance on websites without taking them down. Took out 40 under 40 years ago.
- Dani. Business development person.
- Maybe contact other unis first, demonstrate that it's a Generic problem not a Curtin.
- Google gemaker, they do commercialisation advice more broadly.
