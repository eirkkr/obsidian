## 1. IP Ownership

This document is written entirely from the perspective of how IP ownership relates to the University's 'Intellectual Property Policy' and 'Intellectual Property Procedures'. It does not consider laws which might supersede it (of which there might be some according to my some discussions I've had with experts).

### 1.1 Claim

According to Curtin's '*Intellectual Property Policy*' (March 2024):

> *3.1.2 If an employee develops, creates or authors IP that is not related in any way to their course of duties or a University project and has not used any University resources in developing, creating or authoring that IP, then the employee owns that IP.*

I claim that the creation of the IP was:

1. Not related to my '*course of duties*',
2. Not related to a '*University Project*', and
3. Did not make use of any '*University Resources*'

Hence, I maintain sole ownership of the IP.

The remainder of section 1 explains each of these points using references to the relevant definitions in the University's '*Intellectual Property Policy*'.

### 1.2 'Course of Duties'

Definition from section 5 of Curtin's '*Intellectual Property Policy*' (March 2024):

> *Course of Duties
>
> The scope of duties as set out in the terms and conditions of any relevant enterprise bargaining agreement, contract of employment, duty statement or any other agreement between the individual and the University in effect at the time at which the IP was generated.*

#### 1.2.1 Enterprise Bargaining Agreement (EBA)

After a review of all headings and subheadings in the 2022-2025 EBA, and searching for key words 'intellectual', 'property', 'responsibility', 'duties', and some similar phrases, I could not find any clauses that appear to set out any 'scope of duties'. There is a brief, but not relevant mention of intellectual property.

#### 1.2.2 Contract of Employment

My latest contract of employment for 'Education Data Scientist' as dated 2019-12-18, makes no mention of scope of responsibilities. There is a mention of intellectual property, this is just a reference to the already mentioned 'Intellectual Property Policy'.

#### 1.2.3 Duty Statement (Position Description)

I do not have a record of a position description to accompany my latest contract of a employment (2019-12-18) (it may not have ever existed?). However, as this was essentially a continuation of my previous 'Data and Learning Analyst' role which started on 2016-08-04, the PD for the previous role is likely still relevant. The key responsibilities and accountabilities are copied below for reference. Whilst it talks about building software, it's specifically about building software for specified analytics projects (of which the IP does not relate to).

> KEY RESPONSIBILITIES AND ACCOUNTABILITIES
>
> - Assist in the management of interactions with key stakeholders to capture and formulate analytics hypotheses, and recommend and develop relevant analytics models, which will be required for a range of business domains.
> - Develop and build analytics models, programs and visualisations for specified analytics project aims.
> - Implement and utilise machine learning algorithms required to support specified analytics models.
> - Assist in setting priorities for model development and the definition of data requirements for specified analytics model generation and model maintenance.
> - Assist in the analysis and interpretation of data-driven insights and participate in relevant interactions with key stakeholders to support the transformation of insights into actions.
> - Participate in the use of analytics modeling environment and analytics processing platform selection and implementation.
> - Undertake analysis and usage of learning analytics to facilitate decision-making.
> - Acquire and prepare required data sets for analysis, model generation and derivation of actionable insights.
> - Provide considered business and technical solutions to maximise integration with existing and proposed corporate systems.
> - Work collaboratively to develop features across multiple subsystems within our systems, including requirements definition, prototyping, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
> - Employ industry recognised standards and methodologies to design, develop, test and implement in-house software solutions.
> - Undertake other activities which the incumbent might reasonably be expected to do, and which are consistent with the accountabilities and responsibilities as listed above.

#### 1.2.4 Other Agreements

I do not have any other agreements with the University.

### 1.3 'University Project'

Definition from section 5 of *'Curtin's Intellectual Property Policy' (March 2024):

> University Project
>
> *Work or research administered by or on behalf of the University which:
>
> (a) is funded wholly or in part by a sponsor; or
>
> (b) is commissioned or otherwise funded by the University; or
>
> (c) uses or incorporates University IP or University resources or both; or is a collaborative project, which is either:
>
> (i) a program of work conducted by more than one originator, where each originator's contribution to the IP cannot be separated from the contribution made by other originators; or
>
> (ii) a program of work that originates from, or is an improvement to, University IP.*

The creation of the IP was not administered by or on behalf of the University in any way, hence is not a 'University Project', nor does it relate to one. To further demonstrate the point, very few Curtin staff were even aware that I was working on it, and none who were aware, work in a role which would have the responsibility to administer such a project.

However, this does not preclude the fact that it could become related to a 'University project' in the future, see section 2.

### 1.4 'University Resources'

Definition from section 5 of *'Curtin's Intellectual Property Policy' (March 2024)*

> *University Resources
>
> Resources belonging to the University including without limitation, premises; infrastructure; facilities; funds; services; equipment; paid leave; and employee or University Associate’s time.*

When creating the app, I have been careful to work on it:
1. Completely away from Curtin campuses, almost entirely in my own home (*premises*),
2. Using none of Curtin's infrastructure. This includes digital infrastructure such as Curtin's VPN, applications (e.g. Student One), and cloud infrastructure. I have never accessed any of Curtin's systems or data to work on the IP, even when it would have been beneficial to do so. I provisioned and paid for my own cloud infrastructure rather than using Curtin's existing infrastructure. To further demonstrate the point, if I were to have completely lost all access to Curtin's infrastructure, it would have made no impact on my development of the IP. (*infrastructure*),
3. As per (1), I worked on the IP entirely away from campus, and hence made no use of Curtin facilities. Due to the nature of the IP, no specialised facilities are needed anyway. ('*facilities*'),
4. As per (2), I have financed development of the IP myself, and Curtin has not provided any funds towards it ('*funds*'),
5. I have not engaged with any Curtin services for assistance with creation of the IP. Rather than using Curtin's services I have sought external advice. ('services'),
6. I have only ever used my own equipment (computers, modem, etc.), to develop the app. I have access to Curtin provided equipment (e.g. PC and laptop), but have never used it to develop the IP. To further demonstrate the point, I did not bring my work-provided laptop home with me whilst on LSL, during which much of the IP development was completed. ('equipment'),
7. It is not clear to me what 'paid leave' refers to. It seems non--sensical to me that 'paid leave' is considered a 'University Resource', rather than a resource of staff members. One interpretation is that any staff member creating ANY IP during their paid leave, would be owned by the University, even it it was entirely unrelated to their work at the University. This is against the spirit of the purpose of the 'Intellectual Property Policy' (see below), and is entirely non-sensical, so I doubt is the correct interpretation. I have created some of the IP during my long service leave, i.e. 'paid leave'. However it is worth noting that the definition of 'University Resources' did not exist in the previous March 2017 policy and hence had no mention of 'paid leave' being a 'University Resource'. In addition, creation of the IP began in March 2023 (as evidenced via git commit dates), i.e. prior to the addition of the 'University Resources' definition and 'paid leave' were added in the March 2024 review of the policy. Furthermore, my long service leave has been taken at half pay, and I would not have used more than half of my LSL in development of the IP (although I do not how much time I spend on activities whilst on leave). ('paid leave'),
8. I have developed the IP completely independently, and hence have not engaged the time of any Curtin employee or University Associate. ('*employee or University Associate’s time*')

'*Intellectual Property Policy*' PURPOSE

> *2. PURPOSE
>
> Curtin seeks to foster a culture which values and rewards technology transfer and entrepreneurial endeavour; promotes collaboration between the University, staff and industry; and maximises the benefits to Australia from publicly funded research. Curtin encourages staff to actively engage in commercialisation of intellectual property (IP) and be rewarded for that activity.*

## 2. Risks

### 2.1 Summary

My IP ownership could potentially be put at risk if the situation changes such that:

1. Developing the IP becomes part of my 'course of duties'; or
2. The IP becomes connected to a 'University Project'; or
3. University resources starts to be used to develop the IP

This could potentially happen in the following ways:
- I could be tasked with making use of the IP for the benefit of Curtin, in which case developing the IP could be considered part of my 'course of duties' and it would become
- Curtin may wish to deploy the IP, and I could become involved

**TODO**: List some scenarios by which this might happen.

### 2.2 Mitigation

The following risk mitigation strategies could be put in place to ensure that I maintain ownership of the IP going forward:

1. **Option 1**: As per clause `3.1.1` I could agree in writing with the University, that I maintain ownership over the IP, regardless of whether I develop the IP in the course of my duties, or pursuant to a University project. If Curtin is willing, this is likely the best approach, since it would allow me to maintain ownership of the IP, whilst leaving open the possibility of helping Curtin benefit of the IP. In this scenario it is possible that the University would be contributing to the development of the IP, so an agreement could potentially include a mutually beneficial arrangement whereby, whilst I am an employee of Curtin, I grant discounted/free deployment/use of the intellectual property.
2. **Option 2**: Avoid engaging in any activity which would be considered developing the IP as part of my 'course of duties' with the University, and avoid working with the University on deploying/allowing use of the IP, to ensure that it's development cannot be considered connected to a 'University Project', and hence the University could not claim ownership. This is a less than ideal scenario in which I would maintain IP ownership of the IP, but Curtin does not realise any benefits. Any opportunities for development/collaboration are lost. It would need to be made very clear what cause me to lose IP ownership, so I can avoid doing that.
3. If Curtin does not agree to (1), and (2) presents too much of a risk, of loss of IP ownership, then I could resign from Curtin, thereby eliminating any risk entirely.

## 2. License to University

TODO: Discuss University license.

## 3. Other considerations

However, it is possible that the work I have done could relate to future work that I might do in the course of my duties.

1. Is it worth drafting up an NDA? Probably not, is my guess.
2. Can I get Curtin staff to do testing of the app without having issues? If so, could I get them to do it outside of their work hours without risk? Based on my understanding, yes, as long as it's outside of work hours.
3. Is it ok to use some work time to demonstrate what I've done, is this safe, or should I not track this as work hours?
